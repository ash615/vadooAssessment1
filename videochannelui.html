                            <i><u>60Learning</u></i>, a collaborative learning platform, operates in a crowded space. While they were successfully capturing demand through paid channels, they wanted a really unique way to elevate their brand 
                            and cut through the noise:<br/>
                             Enter: <i><u>Onboarding Joei</u></i>.

                            This first-of-its-kind docu-series follows Joei Chan as she onboards for her new role as 360Learning’s Content Marketing Manager. The series began filming right before the pandemic, which added an extra layer of difficulty as Joei navigated all of the challenges of starting a new job.

                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Although each episode is only five minutes long, Onboarding Joei brings the drama. From setting objectives and key results (OKRs) to navigating a new company’s culture, the series keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. And, by showcasing the series in a Channel, folks can easily watch episodes at their own pace — binge-watching them all in one session or subscribing for new episodes to watch as they go.

                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                            B2B companies often invest in thought leadership to build trust and credibility in their respective industries. Interview series can be a great way to share expertise and opinions in a fun and engaging format — and remember, no one said interviews have to be boring!

                            <u>Terminus</u>, an account-based marketing platform, took a very not-boring approach to their signature series,<u><i> The Roof</u></i>. The series features interviews with internal leaders at Terminus as well as industry experts who tackle topics like “Does SEO still matter?” and “ABM doesn’t work.” The episodes are short and snappy, often filled with wild ideas and hot takes

                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">The premise of the series is simple — all barriers and inhibitions are left on the sidewalk when folks get on the roof. Terminus encourages whoever is being interviewed to really speak their mind on controversial topics, which makes the show super human and relatable. In fact, each episode feels less like an interview and more like a conversation with a friend. Well done, Terminus!</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">We love how they’ve used a Wistia Channel to display these videos in sequential order, so a viewer can effortlessly follow along as they’re unpacking their own product. They’ve also added captions to each video, which not only improves accessibility, but also makes it easy for viewers to watch from around the world — a must-have for a global company.</p>

                            While Talking Sense is intrinsically related to 6Sense’s mission, they’ve decided to give the podcast its own brand by creating a separate domain for it and embedding their Wistia Channel there. We love their creative use of thumbnails and the overall color scheme they chose — just look at that beautiful aqua-blue play button!

                            We’ve covered how Wistia Channels is great for binge-worthy, episodic content — but there’s so much more this handy product can do. A Channel can also be a great home for your company’s webinars or live events. Not only will a Channel elevate the look and feel of your video content, but it can also help you grow an audience and generate leads well after the cameras stop rolling. On-demand content for the win!

                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">We took this very approach for our live event series, (Out Of) Office Hours. Wistia’s Head of Production, Chris Lavigne, hosted a series of streams on all things remote video production. We created a Channel to house the videos, and we’re still seeing engagement with these assets over a year later!</p>
